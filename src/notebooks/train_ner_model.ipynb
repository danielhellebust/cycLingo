Impacts to the side of the rim from falling down or crashing can also cause damage. It may be possible, in some cases, to repair the wheel with adjustments to spoke tension. Begin by checking relative tension in the damaged area. For example, if a wheel deviates in one section to the right, check left and right side spoke tension in that area.',\n   'entities': [(0, 4, 'cycLingo'),\n    (106, 109, 'cycLingo'),\n    (212, 217, 'cycLingo'),\n    (238, 243, 'cycLingo'),\n    (327, 332, 'cycLingo'),\n    (397, 402, 'cycLingo')]}]}"
