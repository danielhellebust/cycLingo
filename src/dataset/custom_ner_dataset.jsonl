Mark a spoke as a reference spoke and measure this one spoke. Write the date of the measurement directly on the rim. This same spoke can be used to double check the original calibration. If the tool is reading different than this reference spoke, the spring tension can be changed. If the tool is reading low, take the tool off the spoke and turn it upside down.

{"id":14079,"text":"Threaded fasteners, such as nuts and bolts, are used to hold many components to the bike. As a fastener is tightened, the fastener actually flexes and stretches, much like a rubber band. This stretching is not permanent, but it gives the joint force to hold together, called preload, or tension. Each fastener is designed for a certain range of tension. Too much tightening will deform the threads or the parts. Too little preload will mean the fastener will loosen with use. This can damage components, such as a crank ridden with a loose mounting bolt. Loose bolts and nuts are also generally the source of various creaking on the bike.","label":[[514,519,"cycLingo"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14080,"text":"Tension in the fastener depends largely upon the amount of torque, the tightening, and the size of the thread. Generally, engineers will specify a thread size large enough to handle the anticipated stresses. For example, the M5 bolt of a water bottle cage bolt would not be a good choice for holding a crank. Even if the bolt were as tight as possible, it would not provide enough force to hold the arm secure to the spindle. The crank-to-spindle interface receives quite a lot of stress, making larger threads (M8, M12, M14) a better choice. The amount of pressure applied by a thread can be substantial in order to hold the joint secure. For example, a fully tightened crank bolt can provide over 14,000 Newton force (3,000 pounds force) as it holds the arm in place.","label":[[302,307,"cycLingo"],[417,424,"cycLingo"],[430,435,"cycLingo"],[439,446,"cycLingo"],[671,676,"cycLingo"]],"Comments":[]}

{"id":14744,"text":"The Travel Agent is a brake cable pulley system that increases the amount of cable pull (Figure 1). The cable is routed around an inner pulley, and then is routed to a larger outer pulley. As the inner pulley rotates, the outer puller will travel around a greater circumference and this increases the linear distance of cable pull. While this system increases the amount (distance) of cable pull, it does not increase the total amount of work done on the cable to stop the bike.","label":[[22,27,"cycLingo"],[28,33,"cycLingo"],[77,82,"cycLingo"],[104,109,"cycLingo"],[240,246,"cycLingo"],[320,325,"cycLingo"],[385,390,"cycLingo"],[455,460,"cycLingo"]],"Comments":[]}

{"id":14749,"text":"The Travel Agent is useful when an incompatible hand brake lever is matched with a brake caliper requiring longer cable pull. For example, the common road lever should never be used with the linear pull caliper brakes, or a mechanical disc brakes. The long arms of linear pull caliper and the mechanical disc MTB brake both require a relatively large amount of cable pull. Using a road lever designed for dual pivot rim calipers will mean the cable will be pulled enough to work effectively. The Travel Agent mechanism was designed as a solution for just this problem.
